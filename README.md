# APPROXIMATION OF A CONTINUOUS MULTIVIBRATOR MODEL BY A MODEL WITH A FINITE SET OF STATES
In this paper, the problem of approximation of a continuous dynamical system by a model with a finite set of states is solved. Approximation allows us to investigate the numerical characteristics and qualitative properties of an object, reducing the task to the study of simpler or more convenient objects. Firstly, it allows for simpler modeling, and secondly, it is a tool for studying the dynamics of the original model.
